The objective of this project is to predict the probability of failure of a machine in the near future. <br>
Therefore, it is possible to deal with costs related to mechanical failures in advance and acting preventatively, saving time and money.

For that specific problem, we are given a set of anonymized variables measured throughout regular time basis units (cycles). These variables are captured for a set of assets (machine id's). Based on these features, we must build a model that allows us to predict the set of assets (machines) that will fail within the next time window fixed at 30 cycles.

We are given a 'training' dataset, a 'test' dataset and a 'truth' table that provides for each machine (id), the number of days (cycles) left before failure.
